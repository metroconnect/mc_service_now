# Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey ServiceNow Injection    

These Javascript scripts are used to inject a new menu bar into the ServiceNow instance when creating a new call.
This enables some automatic form filling abilities for activities such as the creation and closing of calls using a predefined recipe.

# Installation

These scripts are predominently used with the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)  addon for Chrome, or the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) addon for Firefox.

An example of installing the script is shown below, just grab the [servicenow.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metroconnect/mc_service_now/master/servicenow.js) script and paste it into the New Userscript window and save.
